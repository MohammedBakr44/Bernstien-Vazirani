# Introduction
The [Bernstein-Vazirani](https://young.physics.ucsc.edu/150/bv.pdf) problem is like [Deutsch-Joza Algorithm](https://www.qi.damtp.cam.ac.uk/files/QIC-9.pdf), A black box algorithm that demnostrates exponential speedup on a QTM(Quantum Turing Machine) compared to a DTM(Deterministic Turing Machine)[^1].

# Complexity
The problem has a complexity class of BQP(bounded-error quantum polynomial time) and was used to show if $BQP = BPP$ -bounded-error probabilistic polynomial time-.
Which could lead to physical systems being efficiently simulated on DTMs.[^2]

# Problem Statement
Consider a function $f(x) = a \cdot x$, where `dot` means a bitwise inner product modulo 2 addition.
